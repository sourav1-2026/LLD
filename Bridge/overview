// in Bridge pattern, we separate the abstraction (interface) from its implementation (concrete classes) so that both can vary independently.
// This allows us to change the implementation without affecting the clients that use the abstraction. The key components of the Bridge pattern are:


// Here both feature and implementation can change at runtime and provide flexibilty to the system.

1️⃣ Bridge Design Pattern Kya Problem Solve Karta Hai?
        🔥 Main Problem: Combinatorial Explosion of Classes

Jab aapke paas do dimensions ho:

What to be done (Feature)

How it is done (Implementation / Mechanism)

Aur agar aap dono ko ek hi class me mix kar doge,
        to combinations ke hisaab se classes explode kar jaati hain.


🎯 Example: Notification System
What to be done (Feature)

Alert Notification

Reminder Notification

Transaction Notification

How it is done (Implementation)

Email

SMS

Slack

Agar Bridge use nahi karoge, to classes banengi:

AlertEmailNotification

AlertSMSNotification

AlertSlackNotification

ReminderEmailNotification

ReminderSMSNotification

ReminderSlackNotification

TransactionEmailNotification

TransactionSMSNotification

TransactionSlackNotification

👉 Total = 3 × 3 = 9 classes
Kal Teams add hua → 3 aur classes


2️⃣ Bridge Design Pattern Kya Karta Hai?

Bridge pattern:

Separates abstraction (What) from implementation (How)
So that both can vary independently.

💡 Golden Line (Interview Me Bolne Layak)

Bridge pattern separates “What to be done” from “How it is done” to avoid combinatorial explosion and make code scalable and maintainable.


3️⃣ Structure of Bridge Pattern

Bridge me 4 main cheeze hoti hain:

Abstraction → Notification

Refined Abstraction → Alert, Reminder

Implementor → NotificationSender

Concrete Implementor → EmailSender, SMSSender


🔟 Ratane Ka Tarika (Exam / Interview Trick)

Yaad rakhne ka formula:

WHAT + HOW = Bridge

Ya phir:

Feature alag, Functionality alag

Ya phir:

Abstraction holds reference of Implementor

Memory Trick:

🧠 “Bridge banaya hai What aur How ke beech”
